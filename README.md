rack-no-www
===========

This piece of simple middlweware catches requests that begin with "www" 
and redirects them to the equivalent "non-www" address. For example, a 
request to "http://www.example.org" will be redirected to 
"http://example.org".

This kind of redirect adheres to the [no-www philosophy][1], which 
advocates websites having a canonical address without the wasteful "www" 
subdomain. For a site to have a canonical address, it must have a 
single, preferred URL. If a site has multiple URLs that return the same 
content (e.g., a CNAME alias for "http://www.example.org" that points to 
"http://example.org"), search engines might interpret these URLs as 
*different* resources, thus [affecting search rankings and their 
appearance][2]. That's why a site should have a canonical URL. But since 
many users still think "www" is a necessary part of a web address, it's 
important to allow "www" requests and redirect these requests to the 
"non-www" equivalent.

Redirecting to a canonical URL might better be performed at the DNS 
level, or directly by the webserver (e.g., [Apache][3] or [nginx][4]). 
Alas, not all DNS services allow such configuration, and some 
cloud-based hosting solutions, (e.g., [Heroku][5]) don't allow explicit 
server configuration. Hence this piece of middleware.


Installation
------------

    $ gem install rack-no-www


Usage
-----

Simply `require 'rack/no-www'` where appropriate, and then include the 
middleware in the Rack stack. In Rails 3, for example, the 
`config/application.rb` might be adjusted accordingly to place the 
middleware at the top of the Rack stack::

    Module MyApp
      class Application < Rails::Application
        ...
        if Rails.env.production?
          config.middleware.insert_before Rack::Lock, Rack::NoWWW
        end
      end
    end

You can also specify the `:only_hosts` parameter to limit redirection to specific hosts

    config.middleware.use(Rack::NoWWW, only_hosts: "www.example.org")

Requests not made on www.example.org will not be redirected to the root domain.
